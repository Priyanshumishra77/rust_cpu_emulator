TODO

- configurable asm file

- cpu config from Yaml file

- unit tests!

- integration tests!

- support for precise exceptions

- loader: case insensitive keywords/registers

- loader: single line comments

- loader: multiline comment

- loader: new lines

- loader: unwanted semicolon after instructions

- instruction print should use labels

- instructions should keep their labels

- implement CMP

- implement BE

- implement BNE

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen

- implement print of memory

- CPU metrics frequency:
    - currently it is tied to the CPU frequency; but at higher frequency, the output will go too fast.

- load: CPU configuration from disk

DONE

- configurable cpu config

- loader: ast operand should have access to its pos

- labels: unwanted behavior that labels need to start with an _ Even though it isn't part of a label name

- loader: validate memory access

- loader: every instruction should have an optional label in front of it

- loader: label names with underscores

- loader: variable names with underscores

- MemRegisterIndirect
