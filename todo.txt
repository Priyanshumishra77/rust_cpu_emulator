TODO

- function calls

- fix function call: push the instruction pointer in the stack (what about rbp)

- store to load forwarding: currently the store in the sb isn't seen

- loader: every instruction should have an optional label in front of it

- loader: MOV direct value

- memory access should not just be a variable, but could be some expression with one or more registers

- loader: register validation

- loader: validate memory access

- loader: validate variable declaration that it fits in memory

- loader: should not panic on error, but propagate the error to the main

- metrics: instructions issued

- metrics: cycles

- metrics: instructions retired

- metrics: overall ipc

- metrics: ipc last cycle

- program termination

- implement print of memory

- print string

DONE

- special registers like stack pointer, base pointer:
    ideally they are just like general purpose register; just a register and no special treatment

- add constructor functions for operand to make it less tedious to write.

- add push

- add pop

- support for stack

- splitting of backend into separate files.

- loader: a variable can't have the same name as a register.

- printr has no access to its arch reg

- implement AND

- implement OR

- implement XOR

- implement NOT

- loader: should be a struct

- added JZ

- JNZ working
