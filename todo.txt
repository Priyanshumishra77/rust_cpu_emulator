TODO

- cdb broadcast

- printr has no access to its arch reg

- metrics: instructions issued

- metrics: cycles

- metrics: instructions retired

- metrics: overall ipc

- metrics: ipc last cycle

- store to load forwarding

- verify that store works

- branches

- program termination

- implement print of memory

- implement a proper loader

DONE

- the value of the inc isn't visible when printing

- reverse the ordering of the initial free stack for physical registers

- inc is failing with panic

- register rename of the sink should be done after register rename of the source

- fixed problem in execution due to no proper rs.opcode.

- printr isn't being run

- frontend and trace

- retire isn't picked up

- system runs out of rob-etries; so they are not properly returned.
    - retiring isn't working

- cpu_config issue_n_wide

- cpu config dispatch_n_wide

- implement instruction execution

- implement retire

- instructions should have configurable latency

- an instruction should have only 1 sink

- fix the backend compilation problem

- deal with a full store buffer

- instructions: use asserts instead of panics

- allocate a slot in the store buffer
